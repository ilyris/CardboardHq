    Certain cards will duplicate within a portfolio randomly.

    When a user updated their portfolio by removing cards, even if the portfolio % is positive, it shows a negative. (total return goes from 320 -> 298, still shows red negative)
    -- RESOULTION IDEA: Create a table for portfolios by portfolio_id to track historical product changes (qty change, deletions, etc).
